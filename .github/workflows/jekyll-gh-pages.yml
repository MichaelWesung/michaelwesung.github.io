The 25 year calendar is a calendar thought up by me some time ago. Every 5 years is physically a leap year; ergo in only years divisible by 5. Therefore, only years ending in 0 or 5 will be leap years. There is a catch though. Every 25 years is also a double leap year. Therefore if the year ends in 00, 25, 50, or 75, it will be a double leap year. Whereas February has 29 days in a leap year, in a double leap year, February has 30 days. 1 year normally has 365 days and you would be right if you just used a 365 day calendar. But the Earth doesn't quite take 365 days to orbit the sun. It takes almost 365-1/4 days for Earth to go around the sun. That is why we normally have a leap year every 4 years. But it doesn't take the Earth 365-1/4 days to go around the sun either. It takes a little bit less than that. An example could be shown on the Gregorian calendar where it skips 3 leap years every 400 years.

5 years is 1826 days, so there's nothing wrong with having a leap year every 5 years right now, but the Earth takes a little extra time to complete the 5 years; the time it takes for the sun to travel from one point on the ecliptic to the same exact point is called a tropical year. It's a little shorter than the sidereal year and 5 tropical years is about 1826-1/5 days.

25 years is 9131 days, so after 5 times of having 5 years of 1826 days, 25 years would be 9130 days. Therefore the 25 year period would be a day short, and that is why February has to have 30 days.

The 25 year calendar doesn't end there. It also has triple leap years every few centuries to get the seasons back in alignment, and when it does, February actually has 31 days. That means every few centuries, there will be 4 consecutive months of 31 days, starting in December before the triple leap year. Triple leap years follow the same rules as double leap years and while it may be possible to have triple leap years in the same 4 ending years as double leap years: 00, 25, 50, or 75, triple leap years actually occur in only very few of them due to the technical limitations of the calendar and therefore can only appear in years ending in 00 or 50.
